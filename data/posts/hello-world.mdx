title: Hello world
summary: This site has been redesigned, so here is how I did it.

With the amount of work that went into re-building my current website but with a
whole new look & a whole bunch of new features & options, I thought now this
would be a good chance to show some of them off.

## ðŸ”¨ Tech Stack

This project is using the following libraries:

- [React][react] / [Preact][preact] (for production)
- [Next.js][nextjs]
  - [next-seo][next-seo]
  - [next-themes][next-themes]
- [Contentlayer][contentlayer]
  - [Rehype Plugins][rehypejs]
- [Framer Motion][framer-motion]
- [Hamburger React][hamburger-react]
- [TailwindCSS][tailwindcss]
- [Feather Icons][feathericons]

## **âœ¨** Features

With this new re-build comes a whole host of new features & improvements.

### Preact

[Preact][preact] helps a lot with bundle size.

In summary, my Next.js project is configured to replace [React][react] with
[Preact][preact] in production builds.

```ts:next.config.js
webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
  // Replace React with Preact only in client production build:
  if (!dev && !isServer) {
    Object.assign(config.resolve.alias, {
      react: 'preact/compat',
      'react-dom/test-utils': 'preact/test-utils',
      'react-dom': 'preact/compat',
    });
  }

  return config;
},
```

### Blog

As you can tell by the fact you're currently reading this, I now have a
[blog](/blog)!

This means that I finally have a place to create articles that can go more
in-depth on topics I care deeply about.

### Projects

My list of open-source projects is rendered dynamically based on repositories
I have pinned on my GitHub.
Every request made for the page (that isn't already cached) will return a new
list of pinned repositories.

With this, I can update my list of repositories by using GitHub as a form of CMS.

### Spotify

This next feature I am super happy with how it turned out. Using
[Lanyard][lanyard], a service to expose your Discord
presence via a REST API or WebSocket, I was able to display my Spotify status
in real-time on my website.

Also, I added cool animation using [Framer Motion][framer-motion] when I'm
listening to something on Spotify.

### Theme

A very common feature nowadays is offering multiple themes for an application,
so I added it!

Iâ€™m using a really good library, called [next-themes][next-themes], for this
feature, and it offers:

- perfect dark mode in 2 lines of code,
- themed browser UI with color-scheme,
- no flash on load (both SSR and SSG),
- theme synchronization across tabs and windows.
