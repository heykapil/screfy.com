title: How I Built My Website
summary: An in-depth look at the tech stack behind this website.

With the amount of work that went into re-building my current website, but with
a whole new look and a whole bunch of new features, I thought now this would be
a good chance to share an overview of how I built it.

# The Idea

I’ve always liked to have a space on the internet where I can share what I’m
currently building, and what I’m thinking about.

Also, I've challenged myself to create a blog because I've never been good at
writing articles and I think this could improve my writing skills.

# Tech Stack

Choosing the right tech stack is not always easy, especially in this modern
world where you have many great technologies and tools to work with.

## Next.js

[Next.js][nextjs] is a [React][react] framework that gives you all the features
you need for production.

With Next.js, you have a few different options when it comes to page rendering:

- **[SSR (Server-side rendering)][ssr]** - it will pre-render this page on each request server-side.
- **[SSG (Static-site generation)][ssg]** - it will pre-render this page at build time.
- **[ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)][isr]** - it will pre-render this page at build time and then on-demand.

I’ve opted for **SSG** for blog and **ISR** for the collection of my favorite
and most-listened tracks on Spotify, which are automatically updated every 24
hours.

I personally enjoy using Next.js because it comes with built-in performance
benefits and it offers a great developer experience.

## Tailwind

[Tailwind][tailwind] is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to rapidly
build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.

When it comes to the styling, I enjoy using Tailwind every time, it is easy to
pick up and significantly speed up my workflow. It has also a
[VS Code extension][tailwind-extension] for its autocomplete which reduced the
number of times I referenced class names in the docs.

## Contentlayer

[Contentlayer][contentlayer] is a content SDK that validates and transforms your
content into type-safe JSON data.

A simple solution to manage content is a CMS, but I wanted to have an option to
simply use custom React components in my posts. When using a rich-editor in a
CMS, it’s not at all clear how to do this and you’re generally limited to the
handful of HTML elements that these tools can render.

[MDX][mdx] is an extension of Markdown that allows you to use custom React
components, but I didn’t want to focus on setting up MDX with Next.js, so I
chose Contentlayer for a few reasons:

- You can just import content as you would any other library or component.
- It comes with built-in and configurable content validations.
- It supports live reloading with Next.js.

Contentlayer just provides the missing piece needed to maximize developer
experience for modern frameworks.

## Framer Motion

[Framer Motion][framer-motion] is a production-ready motion library for React.

I wanted to have some cool small animations that add the elements more life, so
Framer Motion is a good choice with a great developer experience.

Here is an animation when I'm listening to something on Spotify created with
Framer Motion:

## Vercel

I deploy this site on [Vercel][vercel] because they are the company behind
Next.js, and honestly, I really like their platform.

Whenever I push a change to [my GitHub repository][repository], it is
automatically deployed using Vercel's [GitHub Integration][github-integration].
This allows me to focus on code and don’t think about how to deploy my website.

# Design

The design doesn't come naturally to me, so I gravitate towards minimalist
websites that emphasize content, but just because a design is simple, it doesn’t
mean it should be plain.

This design reflects my values of performance and simplicity.
